# 问题：

最近迷上了英雄联盟手游，由于博主在阿联酋的原因，中东服务器是在12月11号才开放的，之前一直是在台服和日服开VPN玩，但是发现之前的账户如果直接使用中东服务器进行游戏的话是无法匹配，会提示
```
matchmaking time out. please try again
```

# 解决过程：
在尝试了各种解决方案后发现除了重新玩一个小号剩下能摆脱这个问题的方法就是：去拳头官网[开一个ticket](https://support-wildrift.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)。

这是我开了case的原文，博主英语不是很好见笑了。
```

如图所示，最后几番沟通下riot工作人员就帮我把账户转移到了GCC服务器下，然后可以正常的开始游戏了.

```
I see that you're having trouble playing on one of your accounts. To process this request and fix things up we will have to make adjustments to the Shard that your account is on. Changing your Shard will have some side effects on your account.

Any purchases made before the shard transfer will be marked as non-refundable and we will not be able to process these for you after the transfer is complete.
You may lose all Ranked Progress
This includes MMR, Marks, Tier, Fortitude, and Victory Points.
We are unable to reset you or make modifications to your rank
You may not be able to see your chat history prior to your transfer
You may not be able to see your match history or recent players list prior to your transfer
Your wishlist may be reset
Any active consumables (e.g. boosts) will be lost and we are unable to provide you with a replacement
The transfer process can take up to 2-hours to complete and we suggest that you don’t make any progress on your Wild Rift account while the transfer is processing. Any progress made after we start the transfer will be lost and unable to be added to your account post transfer. Once the transfer is complete, you will need to fully log-out of Wild Rift and back in to see your account again.
